This is a web app that predicts stock prices using machine learning models. It uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The app also includes tools like moving averages, price volatility, and RSI to analyze stock trends.

## Features
- Predict stock prices using **LSTM models**.
- Analyze stock trends with **moving averages** and **price volatility**.
- Check **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold.
- Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
- Real-time data fetched using **yfinance** library.
